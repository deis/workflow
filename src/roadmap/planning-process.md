# Planning Process

Deis features a lightweight process that emphasizes openness and ensures every community member can be an integral part of planning for the future.

## The Role of Maintainers

[Maintainers][] lead the Deis projects. Their duties include proposing the Roadmap, reviewing and integrating contributions and maintaining the vision of the project.

## Open Roadmap

The [Deis Roadmap](roadmap.md) is a community document. While Maintainers propose the Roadmap, it gets discussed and refined in Release Planning Meetings.

## Contributing to the Roadmap

Proposals and issues can be opened by anyone. Every member of the [community][] is welcome to participate in the discussion by providing feedback and/or offering counter-proposals.

## Release Milestones

The Roadmap gets delivered progressively via the [Release Schedule][].  Releases are defined during Release Planning Meetings and managed using GitHub Milestones which track specific deliverables and work-in-progress.

## Release Planning Meetings

Major decisions affecting the Roadmap are discussed during Release Planning Meetings on the first Thursday of each month, aligned with the [Release Schedule][].

Release Planning Meetings are open to the public with access coordinated via the [Deis #community Slack channel](https://slack.deis.io).
Notes from past meetings are below, along with links to a recording of the entire meeting on YouTube.
